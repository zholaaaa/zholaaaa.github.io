		<h2>Since beginning my journey as a freelance web developer nearly 2 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my chops.</h2>
	  <h2>I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. My skills are broad: from ux to design, front end to back end development. I enjoy each aspect, and love building sites & web apps from start to finish, for clients all over the world.</h2>
